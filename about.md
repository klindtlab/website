# About Klindt Lab

The Klindt Lab, led by Assistant Professor David Klindt at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, is dedicated to advancing our understanding of neural computation through the lens of artificial intelligence. We investigate how brains learn structured representations and process information in changing environments.

## Our Mission

We strive to bridge the gap between neuroscience and AI by:

- Understanding how brains navigate changing sensory environments
- Developing more robust and adaptable AI models inspired by biology
- Investigating neural representations and generalization across contexts
- Creating biologically-plausible learning algorithms

## Research Philosophy

As David notes: *"AI models sometimes break down in cases where biology doesn't."* 

We believe that biological systems hold the key to developing more resilient artificial intelligence. Our approach combines:

- **Computational Rigor**: Applying advanced machine learning techniques to biological questions
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Working across neuroscience, AI, and cognitive science  
- **Open Science**: Sharing our code, data, and findings with the community
- **Biological Inspiration**: Learning from evolution's solutions to intelligence

## Part of CSHL's NeuroAI Initiative

Our lab is part of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's innovative NeuroAI program, which brings together expertise in motor and perceptual skills to advance our understanding of intelligence. This initiative is supported by CSHL's "Foundations for the Future" project.
