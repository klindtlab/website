# About Klindt Lab

The Klindt Lab is dedicated to advancing our understanding of neural computation through the lens of artificial intelligence. We combine theoretical neuroscience, computational modeling, and machine learning to uncover the principles underlying intelligent behavior.

## Our Mission

We strive to bridge the gap between neuroscience and AI by:

- Developing biologically-plausible neural network models
- Understanding how neural circuits process sensory information
- Creating AI systems inspired by brain function
- Investigating the computational principles of learning and memory

## Lab Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Collaborative Research**: Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration
- **Open Science**: Sharing our code, data, and findings with the community
- **Rigorous Methods**: Applying computational rigor to biological questions
- **Innovation**: Pushing the boundaries of both neuroscience and AI
