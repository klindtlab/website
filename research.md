# Research Areas

## Neural Circuit Modeling

We develop computational models to understand how neural circuits process and transform sensory information. Our work combines detailed biophysical models with abstract computational frameworks.

**Key Projects:**
- Retinal computation and visual processing
- Cortical circuit dynamics
- Sensory adaptation mechanisms

## Machine Learning & Neuroscience

We explore how insights from neuroscience can improve machine learning algorithms and how AI techniques can help us understand the brain.

**Key Projects:**
- Biologically-inspired deep learning architectures
- Neural network interpretability
- Continual learning mechanisms

## Computational Perception

Understanding how the brain constructs our perception of the world through computational principles.

**Key Projects:**
- Visual object recognition
- Motion perception
- Multisensory integration
