abstract: 'Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
  interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The Platonic
  view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH), suggests that
  despite different methods and engineering approaches, all representations converge
  to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon lacks precise theoretical explanation.
  By synthesizing evidence from Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH
  can emerge in SSL. However, current IT cannot explain SSL’s empirical success. To
  bridge the gap between theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we
  term Singular Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing
  the entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
  assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable and
  generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for future
  research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the impact
  of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of inductive
  biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and optimizers.'

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH), suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However, current IT cannot explain SSL’s empirical success. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and optimizers.
