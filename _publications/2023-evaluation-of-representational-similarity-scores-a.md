abstract: We investigate several popular methods for quantifying the similarity between
  neural representations applied to a large-scale fMRI dataset of human ventral visual
  cortex. We focus on representational geometry as a framework for comparing various
  functionally-defined high-level regions of interest (ROIs) in the ventral stream.
  We benchmark Representational Similarity Analysis, Centered Kernel Alignment, and
  Generalized Shape Metrics. We explore how well the geometry implied by pairwise
  representational dissimilarity scores produced by each method matches the 2D anatomical
  geometry of visual cortex. Our results suggest that while these methods yield similar
  outcomes, Shape Metrics provide distances between representations whose relation
  to the anatomical geometry is most invariant across subjects. Our work establishes
  a criterion with which to compare methods for quantifying representational similarity
  with implications for studying the anatomical organization of high-level ventral
  visual cortex.
