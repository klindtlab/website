abstract: The tremendous success of generative models in recent years raises the question
  whether they can also be used to perform classification. Generative models have
  been used as adversarially robust classifiers on simple datasets such as MNIST,
  but this robustness has not been observed on more complex datasets like CIFAR-10.
  Additionally, on natural image datasets, previous results have suggested a trade-off
  between the likelihood of the data and classification accuracy. In this work, we
  investigate score-based generative models as classifiers for natural images. We
  show that these models not only obtain competitive likelihood values but simultaneously
  achieve state-of-the-art classification accuracy for generative classifiers on CIFAR-10.
  Nevertheless, we find that these models are only slightly, if at all, more robust
  than discriminative baseline models on out-of-distribution tasks based on common
  image corruptions. Similarly and contrary to prior results, we find that score-based
  are prone to worst-case distribution shifts in the form of adversarial perturbations.
  Our work highlights that score-based generative models are closing the gap in classification
  accuracy compared to standard discriminative models. While they do not yet deliver
  on the promise of adversarial and out-of-domain robustness, they provide a different
  approach to classification that warrants further research.
