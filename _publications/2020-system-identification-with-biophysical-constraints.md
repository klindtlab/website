abstract: Visual processing in the retina has been studied in great detail at all
  levels such that a comprehensive picture of the retina's cell types and the many
  neural circuits they form is emerging. However, the currently best performing models
  of retinal function are black-box CNN models which are agnostic to such biological
  knowledge. In particular, these models typically neglect the role of the many inhibitory
  circuits involving amacrine cells and the biophysical mechanisms underlying synaptic
  release. Here, we present a computational model of temporal processing in the inner
  retina, including inhibitory feedback circuits and realistic synaptic release mechanisms.
  Fit to the responses of bipolar cells, the model generalized well to new stimuli
  including natural movie sequences, performing on par with or better than a benchmark
  black-box model. In pharmacology experiments, the model replicated in silico the
  effect of blocking specific amacrine cell populations with high fidelity, indicating
  that it had learned key circuit functions. Also, more in depth comparisons showed
  that connectivity patterns learned by the model were well matched to connectivity
  patterns extracted from connectomics data. Thus, our model provides a biologically
  interpretable data-driven account of temporal processing in the inner retina, filling
  the gap between purely black-box and detailed biophysical modeling.
