We're excited to announce that our paper on neural network interpretability has been accepted for publication! 

This work explores how principles from computational neuroscience can help us better understand what deep learning models learn and how they make decisions.

Key contributions include:
- Novel visualization techniques for network activations
- Connections between biological and artificial neural representations  
- Applications to computer vision and natural language processing

The paper will be available on our publications page soon, along with open-source code for reproducing our results.
