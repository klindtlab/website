We're thrilled to announce that David Klindt has joined Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) as Assistant Professor, becoming part of CSHL's innovative NeuroAI program!

## Research Focus

David's research aims to understand how brains navigate changing sensory environments using machine learning approaches. His goal is to develop more sensitive and adaptable artificial intelligence models by studying how biological systems perceive and adapt to changing environments.

As David explains: *"AI models sometimes break down in cases where biology doesn't."*

## Background

Before joining CSHL, David completed:
- **Postdoctoral research** at Stanford University
- **Ph.D.** from University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany  
- **Research scientist role** at Meta focusing on machine learning

## CSHL's NeuroAI Initiative

David joins CSHL during an exciting period of expansion as part of the new "Foundations for the Future" project. The NeuroAI initiative aims to bring together expertise in motor and perceptual skills to advance our understanding of intelligence.

## What's Next

The Klindt Lab will focus on bridging computational neuroscience and AI, developing models that are more robust and adaptable by taking inspiration from biological learning mechanisms.

Welcome to CSHL, David! ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–
