abstract: Although the processing of visual information in the retina has been studied
  in detail, the underlying functional connectivity is not yet completely understood.
  While many specific circuits are well-characterized (eg the rod photoreceptor pathway),
  a comprehensive picture of how these microcircuits work together to form the retinal
  network is still lacking. Furthermore, connectomic information, which could help
  dissect the functional underpinnings of the retina, is not yet fully leveraged.
  The integration of different datasets and data sources to (computational) models
  is a key challenge to elucidate the processing of visual information in the retina.
  A step towards a comprehensive understanding of the retinal network was made in
  a recent publication [1], which suggests a biophysically-constrained bipolar and
  amacrine cell network model (BCN model) of light processing in the mouse inner retina,
  enabling in silico experiments. Here, we extended this model to predict the responses
  of previously characterized mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types to full-field
  light stimulation [2]. Specifically, we tested how bipolar cell glutamate release
  can be combined in an additional linear nonlinear model to predict RGC output (BCN-LN).
  We show that recordings of full-field stimulation combined with mechanistically
  detailed modelling allowed us to predict connectivity between cell types, as well
  as to investigate the role of inhibitory feedback and feedforward AC modulation.
  In summary, this work shows how a machine-learning approach informed by biological
  structures can produce interpretable and accurate predictions about neural connectivity
  and circuit …
