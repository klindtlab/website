abstract: Mentalizing or Theory of Mind (ToM), i.e., the ability to recognize what
  people think or feel, is a crucial component of human social intelligence. It has
  been recently proposed that ToM can be decomposed into automatic and controlled
  neurocognitive components, where only the latter engage executive functions (e.g.,
  working memory, inhibitory control and task switching). Critical here is the notion
  that such dual processes are expected to follow different developmental dynamics.
  In this work, we provide novel experimental evidence for this notion. We report
  data gathered from about thirty thousand participants of a massive web poll of people's
  cognitive skills, which included ToM and executive functions. We show that although
  the maturation of executive functions occurs in synchrony (around 20 years of age),
  this is not the case for different mentalizing competences, which either mature
  before (for elementary ToM …
