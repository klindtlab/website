abstract: This paper presents the computational challenge on differential geometry
  and topology that was hosted within the ICLR 2022 workshop “Geometric and Topo-logical
  Representation Learning”. The competition asked participants to provide implementations
  of machine learning algorithms on manifolds that would respect the API of the open-source
  software Geomstats (manifold part) and Scikit-Learn (machine learning part) or PyTorch.
  The challenge attracted seven teams in its two month duration. This paper describes
  the design of the challenge and summarizes its main findings.
