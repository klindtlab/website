abstract: Minimal experiments, such as head-fixed wheel-running and sleep, offer experimental
  advantages but restrict the amount of observable behavior, making it difficult to
  classify functional cell types. Arguably, the grid cell, and its striking periodicity,
  would not have been discovered without the perspective provided by free behavior
  in an open environment. Here, we show that by shifting the focus from single neurons
  to populations, we change the minimal experimental complexity required. We identify
  grid cell modules and show that the activity covers a similar, stable toroidal state
  space during wheel running as in open field foraging. Trajectories on grid cell
  tori correspond to single trial runs in virtual reality and path integration in
  the dark, and the alignment of the representation rapidly shifts with changes in
  experimental conditions. Thus, we provide a methodology to discover and study complex
  internal representations …
