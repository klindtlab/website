abstract: Molecules are essential building blocks of life and their different conformations
  (i.e., shapes) crucially determine the functional role that they play in living
  organisms. Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) allows for acquisition of large
  image datasets of individual molecules. Recent advances in computational cryo-EM
  have made it possible to learn latent variable models of conformation landscapes.
  However, interpreting these latent spaces remains a challenge as their individual
  dimensions are often arbitrary. The key message of our work is that this interpretation
  challenge can be viewed as an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) problem where
  we seek models that have the property of identifiability. That means, they have
  an essentially unique solution, representing a conformational latent space that
  separates the different degrees of freedom a molecule is equipped with in nature.
  Thus, we aim to advance the computational field of cryo-EM beyond visualizations
  as we connect it with the theoretical framework of (nonlinear) ICA and discuss the
  need for identifiable models, improved metrics, and benchmarks. Moving forward,
  we propose future directions for enhancing the disentanglement of latent spaces
  in cryo-EM, refining evaluation metrics and exploring techniques that leverage physics-based
  decoders of biomolecular systems. Moreover, we discuss how future technological
  developments in time-resolved single particle imaging may enable the application
