abstract: The retina transforms patterns of light into visual feature representations
  supporting behaviour. These representations are distributed across various types
  of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose spatial and temporal tuning properties have
  been studied extensively in many model organisms, including the mouse. However,
  it has been difficult to link the potentially nonlinear retinal transformations
  of natural visual inputs to specific ethological purposes. Here, we discover a nonlinear
  selectivity to chromatic contrast in an RGC type that allows the detection of changes
  in visual context. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on large-scale
  functional recordings of RGC responses to natural mouse movies, and then used this
  model to search in silico for stimuli that maximally excite distinct types of RGCs.
  This procedure predicted centre colour opponency in transient suppressed-by-contrast
  (tSbC) RGCs, a cell type whose function is being debated. We confirmed experimentally
  that these cells indeed responded very selectively to Green-OFF, UV-ON contrasts.
  This type of chromatic contrast was characteristic of transitions from ground to
  sky in the visual scene, as might be elicited by head or eye movements across the
  horizon. Because tSbC cells performed best among all RGC types at reliably detecting
  these transitions, we suggest a role for this RGC type in providing contextual information
  (ie sky or ground) necessary for the selection of appropriate behavioural responses
  to other stimuli, such as looming objects. Our work showcases how a combination
  of experiments with natural stimuli and computational modelling allows …
