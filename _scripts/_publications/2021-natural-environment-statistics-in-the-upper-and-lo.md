abstract: Pressures for survival make sensory circuits adapted to a species' natural
  habitat and its behavioral challenges. Thus, to advance our understanding of the
  visual system, it is essential to consider an animal's specific visual environment
  by capturing natural scenes, characterizing their statistical regularities, and
  using them to probe visual computations. Mice, a prominent visual system model,
  have salient visual specializations, being dichromatic with enhanced sensitivity
  to green and UV in the dorsal and ventral retina, respectively. However, the characteristics
  of their visual environment that likely have driven these adaptations are rarely
  considered. Here, we built a UV-green-sensitive camera to record footage from mouse
  habitats. This footage is publicly available as a resource for mouse vision research.
  We found chromatic contrast to greatly diverge in the upper, but not the lower,
  visual field. Moreover, training a …
