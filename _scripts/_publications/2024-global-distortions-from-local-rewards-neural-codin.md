abstract: Grid cells in the mammalian brain are fundamental to spatial navigation,
  and therefore crucial to how animals perceive and interact with their environment.
  Traditionally, grid cells are thought support path integration through highly symmetric
  hexagonal lattice firing patterns. However, recent findings show that their firing
  patterns become distorted in the presence of significant spatial landmarks such
  as rewarded locations. This introduces a novel perspective of dynamic, subjective,
  and action-relevant interactions between spatial representations and environmental
  cues. Here, we propose a practical and theoretical framework to quantify and explain
  these interactions. To this end, we train path-integrating recurrent neural networks
  (piRNNs) on a spatial navigation task, whose goal is to predict the agent's position
  with a special focus on rewarded locations. Grid-like neurons naturally emerge from
  the training of piRNNs, which allows us to investigate how the two aspects of the
  task, space and reward, are integrated in their firing patterns. We find that geometry,
  but not topology, of the grid cell population code becomes distorted. Surprisingly,
  these distortions are global in the firing patterns of the grid cells despite local
  changes in the reward. Our results indicate that after training with location-specific
  reward information, the preserved representational topology supports successful
  path integration, whereas the emergent heterogeneity in individual responses due
  to global distortions may encode dynamically changing environmental cues. By bridging
  the gap between computational models and the biological reality of spatial navigation
  under reward …
