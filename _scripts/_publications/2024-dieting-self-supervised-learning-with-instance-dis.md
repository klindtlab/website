abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods often consist of elaborate pipelines
  with hand-crafted data augmentations and computational tricks. However, it is unclear
  what is the provably minimal set of building blocks that ensures good downstream
  performance. The recently proposed instance discrimination method, coined DIET,
  stripped down the SSL pipeline and demonstrated how a simple SSL algorithm can work
  by predicting the sample index. Our work proves that DIET recovers cluster-based
  latent representations, while successfully identifying the correct cluster centroids
  in its classification head. We demonstrate the identifiability of DIET on synthetic
  data adhering to and violating our assumptions, revealing that the recovery of the
  cluster centroids is even more robust than the feature recovery.
